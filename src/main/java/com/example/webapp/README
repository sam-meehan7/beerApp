This application is a Spring based app which fetches data from an external API.

I use a service class and a GET request to fetch and return the data in its entirety from the chosen API
(http://api.brewerydb.com/v2/beer/random/?withBreweries=Y&hasLabels=Y&key=a5c1b917e7ba62dcd79f434ed73bc72d)

I then use a controller class to create a ModelAndView which maps chosen data and renders it to a jsp file which can
be then viewed on the browser (http://localhost:8080/)

Using a RESTApi I then rendered chosen values to http://localhost:8080/api/beer
